**********************************************************************************
## To make an eaglercraft 1.12x server, follow the instructions below:
Here is how you can setup a connection:
<br>
now you have your own free server instance to host eaglercraft. Next you need to run the setup commands:
<br>
Create a terminal tab and paste the following:<br>
<br>
First, in the codespace terminal enter the First command.
<br>
Then, click on the `+` in the bar where the console tab is located. In there enter the second command.
<br>

Commands:
1. ```
   cd server && sudo java -jar server.jar
   ```
3. ```
   cd bungee && sudo java -jar bungee.jar
   ```

***********************************************************************************
<br>
Now go to the ports area and forward (and make public by right clicking the port and changing the port visibility to public) port 
<br>
To use the server console, go to the first terminal "sudo", not the "bash", second terminal thats for the Velocity proxy.
<br>

Load up the client, port `8081` ! When you are in, copy the link, paste it in the add server section, replace https:// with wss:// and join!
Your eaglercraft 1.12.2 server is setup!
<br>

* `ViaVersion Bukkit 3.5.1`

`PS: You can use this as a normal server too (like properly hosted) just clone this repo and run it in much the same way.`
